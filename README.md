# Diabetes-Patients

# About Dataset
This dataset is originally from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney
Diseases. The objective of the dataset is to diagnostically predict whether a patient has diabetes
based on certain diagnostic measurements included in the dataset. Several constraints were placed
on the selection of these instances from a larger database. In particular, all patients here are females
at least 21 years old of Pima Indian heritage.2
From the data set in the (.csv) File We can find several variables, some of them are independent
(several medical predictor variables) and only one target dependent variable (Outcome).

# Project Overview:

This project focuses on predictive analysis for diabetes diagnosis using a dataset originally sourced from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. The dataset contains various medical and demographic variables for a group of Pima Indian heritage females who are at least 21 years old.

The primary objective of this project is to develop a predictive model that can diagnostically predict whether a patient has diabetes based on the provided diagnostic measurements and demographic information.
